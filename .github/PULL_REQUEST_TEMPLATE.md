# Code Review Policy

* CI must pass (enforced)
* 1 review is mandatory (enforced), 2 or more ideal
* If you believe your change is simple, and non-controversial enough, and you want
  to avoid merge conflicts, or blocking work before it gets enough reviews, label it with
  `needs further review` label and Merge it.

See https://github.com/fedimint/fedimint/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#code-review-policy for
full description.
